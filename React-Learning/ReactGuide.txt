React Routing:
cmd: npm i raect-router-dom
For Static-Routing:
add varaible on index.js it should look like that!
let allRoutes=createBrowserRouter(
  [
    {
      path:'/',
      element:<Home/>
    },
    {
      path:'about-us',
      element:<About/>
    },
    {
      path: 'contact',
      element:<Contact/>
    }
  ]
and add this line after <React.StictMode>
<RouterProvider router={allRoutes}/>

For Dynamic-Routing:
Dynamic route is the route that is route in the route mean if you have a product page if you click on that product you will be going in an component that is on the component so to do that :
simply add in createBrowserRouter
{
   path: 'product/:id',
   element: '<Productdetails/>
},
where :id is the dynamic means you can change it the loop or any other you want to change it to do that add:
<Link to={`/blog/{id}`>Product -1 <Link/>
now where id will be the id of the product it could also be index or any thing you like.
Now you have the page that is the component but in that component the product will be changed!
